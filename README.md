# ðŸ§  Intelligent Behavior Monitoring with Keypoint Detection and Person Re-Identification

University project developed for the course **Neural Networks Theory and Practice**.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Goal

This project aims to develop a deep learning-based system that performs:

- **Human detection and pose estimation (keypoint detection)**
- **Tracking and Re-Identification (Re-ID) of people over time**
- **Behavior classification** based on human poses (e.g., squats, fights, falls)
- **Automatic alerts and logging** when predefined behaviors are detected
- **Interactive visualization** of the system's output in real-time

## ðŸ§© System Overview

The system consists of the following modules:

1. **Person detection** â€“ YOLOv8 or Detectron2
2. **Keypoint detection** â€“ HRNet / ViTPose using MMPose
3. **Tracking and Re-Identification** â€“ DeepSORT or BoT-SORT with OSNet
4. **Behavior classification** â€“ LSTM / Transformer on keypoint sequences
5. **Alerts and logging** â€“ Rule-based triggers based on classified behaviors
6. **Visualization** â€“ Real-time feedback via OpenCV and Streamlit dashboard
