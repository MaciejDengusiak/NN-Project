# Project main goals
- compare custom made models with precomputed models
- compare action recognition based on 'image videos' and 'skeleton videos'
- inspect trained models - what kernels were found and how do some layers behave based on given inpt
- (optional) try to find some optimal input for some output

# Todo workfow
- Data:
  - [ ] Keypoints Detection
    - [ ] Find and dowlnoad data
    - [ ] Preprocess data and create datasets
    - [ ] Create dataloaders

  - [ ] Actions Recognition
    - [ ] Find and dowlnoad data
    - [ ] Preprocess data and create datasets
    - [ ] Create dataloaders

  - [ ] Create Keypoint-Based Action Recognition Dataset

- Models:
  - [ ] Find
    - [ ] Imgae -> Keypoints
    - [ ] Image Video -> Action

  - [ ] Implement
    - [ ] Imgae -> Keypoints
    - [ ] Image Video -> Action
    - [ ] Keypoints Vide -> Action

- [ ] Train Implemented models

- Check results
  - [ ] Comapre preview of few samples
  - [ ] Compare few types of loss'es
  - [ ] Compare Keypoints vs Image Action detection
